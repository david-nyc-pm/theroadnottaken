        <h2>The Road Not Taken</h2> 
        <h3>by Robert Frost</h3>
    </div>
      <p>
        Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,<br>
        And sorry I could not travel both<br>
        And be one traveler, long I stood<br>
        And looked down one as far as I could<br>
        To where it bent in the undergrowth;
      </p>
      <p>
        Then took the other, as just as fair,<br>
        And having perhaps the better claim,<br>
        Because it was grassy and wanted wear;<br>
        Though as for that the passing there<br>
        Had worn them really about the same,

        And both that morning equally lay<br>
        In leaves no step had trodden black.<br>
        Oh, I kept the first for another day!<br>
        Yet knowing how way leads on to way,<br>
        I doubted if I should ever come back.
      </p>
      <p>
        I shall be telling this with a sigh<br>
        Somewhere ages and ages hence:<br>
        Two roads diverged in a wood, and I-<br>
        I took the one less traveled by,<br>
        And that has made all the difference.

    <h2><center>About the Author</center></h2>
      <p><b>Robert Lee Frost (1874-1963)</b> was a noteworthy American poet. His poetry found its first audience in England before making waves back home in the United States. Frost had a knack for capturing the essence of rural life with a distinctly American flavor of speech. He often drew inspiration from the New England countryside of the early 20th century, weaving complex social and philosophical questions into his observations of simple, everyday settings.
      </br></br>
      Throughout his life, Frost was celebrated and remains the only poet to have snagged four Pulitzer Prizes for Poetry. He truly became an iconic figure in American literature, almost akin to a national treasure. In 1960, his contributions to poetry were further recognized with a Congressional Gold Medal. And not stopping there, on July 22, 1961, Vermont declared him its poet laureate, cementing his legacy as one of America's most cherished literary voices.</p>
