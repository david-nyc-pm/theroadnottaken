Project Title: A Poem That Reflects on My Learning Webdev

Project Description: For this project, I chose a poem that reflects on my learning web development. Taking this path is one I never thought I would and for someone who has yet to study nor would likely study a technical field/subject, it is for me the "path less traveled". 

I chose to focus less on a large amount of content and more on the CSS side, ensuring that I create a visually appealing site does not overpower but compliments the poem itself. I practiced using a variety of CSS techniques on the containers, which feature two gradients: one in the body and on in the border. I choose a monochromatic theme and utilized an image with a transparent background to help play into the seamless flow of the page. 

How to Use This Project: Simply read the poem, reflect, and enjoy! Also, feel free to learn more about the poem by taking a look at the link within the "About the Poet" section.
